# NLP-project---mean-tweets-detector

This is a project i have been working on for Natural Language Processing. 

I used a data source from Kaggle, and seperated the code for 3 different files 

'Visualize'  - This was meant to create 2 new data sources and remove all the NULL values i found in the datasets. Turns out i didnt needed it in the end because all the NULL values were associated with keyword columns, and i did not used that in the end. I left it for example only. 

'Model' - In this file i went and started with feature engineering and moved to create the model and compare results with MultinominaNB and SVC. 

'Test' - Here i did the final test and took the test dataset and applied it to the model to get the results which i submitted to Kaggle for the competition. 


Happy to hear feedback if anyone see this and have some notes for improvement or suggestions. :)
